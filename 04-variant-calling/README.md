Create a .vcf file; variant calling using the .bam alligned files. 
Filtering and merging into a single vcf file.
Also calculate the missingness per individual (quality control)

The scripts for variant calling of single samples and merging of their sequences into a single fasta file are to create a multi-sample fasta file (of the mitochondrial genome in this case) for phylogenetic analysis
